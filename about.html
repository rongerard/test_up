                "Sort a Element" is an interactive sorting game that leverages the drag and drop functionality of jQuery
                UI.
                Players are challenged to categorize elements from the periodic table into their respective groups with
                precision and accuracy.
                For instance, Helium (He) must be strategically placed within the Noble Gases category. <br>

                <br>Our game is meticulously crafted with the aim of transforming the exploration of the periodic table
                into an engaging and
                immersive experience. By seamlessly blending entertainment with educational content, we endeavor to
                foster a deeper
                understanding and appreciation for the intricacies of chemical elements.
